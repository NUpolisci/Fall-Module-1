# Objectives for today 

1. Keeping code tidy 
2. Basic plots in R
3. Distributions

# Keeping code tidy 

COMMENT YOUR CODE!! Your future self, your coauthors, and replicators will appreciate it.

Comments are written with hashtags #. R will not run anything that comes after one. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a vector with birthdates
bday <- c(1993,1991,1996,1989)
# Calculate mean 
mean(bday)
```

---
# Keeping code tidy 

Create sections of code by using four hashtags (or dashes) after your section title. This will make it easier to find your spot on the code (they will get long!).

```{r  out.height="60%", out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("sections.png") 
```

---
# Keeping code tidy 

At the top of your code: 

- set your working directory 
- load your libraries 

---
# Keeping code tidy 

- use `<-` as your assignment mechanism, NOT `= `

- use spaces between operators, like `=`, `<-`, `~`

- when code is long, hit Enter to make it into several lines

# Keeping it tidy 

GOOD: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# GOOD 
mod1 <- lm(formula = weight ~ height + age + gender) 
```

BAD: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# BAD
mod1<-lm(formula=weight~height+age+gender)
```

# Loading our data again

```{r}
library(readr)
drugs_data <- read_csv("drugs.csv")
```

---
# Exploring variables

Also a good idea to always explore the specific variable you are interested in.

- get a table 
- get descriptives
- draw graphs
- look for: answer choices, outliers, NAs, labels, distribution

---
# Exploring variables

```{r}
table(drugs_data$mjage)
summary(drugs_data$mjage)
```

---
# Exploring variables: visualization

Visualization is key! 

You will learn how to do beautiful graphs with ggplot in future weeks, but for quick graphs we can always use Base R:

- Histogram: hist()
- Scatter plot: plot()
- Boxplot: boxplot()
- Bar graph: barplot()

---
# Histogram

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
hist(drugs_data$mjage)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(drugs_data$mjage)
```
]

---
# Boxplot 

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
boxplot(drugs_data$mjage ~ drugs_data$health_cond)

# ALT:
# boxplot(mjage ~ health_cond, data = drugs_data)

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(drugs_data$mjage ~ drugs_data$health_cond)
```
]

---
# Bar graph

.pull-left[
```{r, eval= FALSE}

health_cond_freq <- table(drugs_data$health_cond)

barplot(health_cond_freq)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
health_cond_freq <- table(drugs_data$health_cond)
barplot(health_cond_freq)
```

]

---
# Scatter plot 
.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(drugs_data$mjage, drugs_data$cigtry)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(drugs_data$mjage, drugs_data$cigtry)
```
]

# Making plots nicer 

These plots can look nicer: check out the help file for each plot type to see how we can adjust it to add color, change labels, etc. 

Look at the help for .green[barplot] and see if you can figure out how to:

- add a title 
- change the bars to a horizontal position

# Probabilities in R

---
# Base R

```{r  out.height="80%", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("navarro.png") 
```
- `q_` is inverse of `p_`, i.e. inverse of CDF. We give it a cumulative probability and it spits out at which value of X we should get this probability

.footnote[Navarro, [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) p.287]

# Normal distribution 

Specifically, let's work with a Standard Normal (mean = 0, sd = 1)

To get a CDF associated with a specific x:

pnorm() --> this is what we get from the Z tables!

```{r}
pnorm(1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
---
# Normal distribution 

That means that 97.5% of obs are lower than 1.96. What % of obs is greater? 

Option 1:
```{r}
1-pnorm(1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
Option 2: 
```{r}
pnorm(1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
---
# Normal distribution 

With qnorm() we can do the inverse procedure: get the x corresponding to a given quantile.  How large will by Z have to be so that I can reject the null at a 95% confidence level? 

```{r}
qnorm(.975, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
Z score for 50th quantile? 

--
```{r}
qnorm(.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

# Getting Probabilities
```{r echo=F,  fig.width = 14 ,fig.height = 6}
grid <- seq(-3,3, length.out = 3000)
our_normal <- Normal(mu=0, sigma=1)
density <- pdf(Normal(), grid)

data <- tibble(Support = grid, Probability = density)

p_grid <- 1.2


data <- data %>% 
  mutate(color_cdf=case_when(
    grid <= p_grid ~ "#0A782D",
    grid > p_grid ~ "#2A96F5"
                            ),
    color_pdf = case_when(
      grid == p_grid ~ "#0A782D",

    ), 
    reject = case_when(
      grid <= p_grid ~ density,

# Binomial distribution 

Find the pr. of x successes 

Coin toss: probability that I will get .green[*exactly*] 3 heads (#successes) in 4 tosses (#trials)

```{r}
dbinom(x = 3, size = 4, p = 0.5)
```

---
# Binomial distribution

What is the probability that it will get .green[*at most*] 3 heads? 

This equals: pr of no heads + pr 1 head + pr 2 heads + pr 3 heads

```{r}
pbinom(3, size = 4, p= 0.5)
```

Check:
```{r}
dbinom(0, size = 4, p= 0.5) + dbinom(1, size = 4, p= 0.5) + dbinom(2, size = 4, p= 0.5) + dbinom(3, size = 4, p= 0.5)
```

---
# Binomial distribution 

How many heads would I have to get to get a 50% success rate? 

```{r}
qbinom(0.5, size = 4, p = 0.5)
```

# Using Distributions3 package 

Requires us to create an object with the distribution first.
But names of functions are much more intuitive! 

dnorm() --> pdf()

pnorm() --> cdf()

qnorm() --> quantile()

---
# Normal distribution 

```{r}
our_normal <- Normal(mu = 0, sigma = 1)
cdf(our_normal, 1.96)
quantile(our_normal, 0.975)
```

---
# Binomial distributions

```{r}
fair_coin <- Binomial(size = 4, p=0.5)
pdf(fair_coin, 3)
```
Probability of at least 3 heads: 

```{r}
cdf(fair_coin, 3)

pdf(fair_coin,0) + pdf(fair_coin,1) + pdf(fair_coin, 2) + pdf(fair_coin, 3)
```

1. From last class: Explore the variable cigtry. Are there any outliers? Plot this variable. 

2. Draw a boxplot between education level (`educ`) and age at which they tried smokeless cigarettes (`smklsstry`). Does this look strange? Why? 

3. Suppose the height of males at a certain school is normally distributed with a mean of μ=70 inches and a standard deviation of σ = 2 inches. Approximately what percentage of males at this school are taller than 74 inches?

4. Bob makes 60% of his free-throw attempts. If he shoots 12 free throws, what is the probability that he makes exactly 10?

5. Suppose the height of plants in a certain region is normally distributed with a mean of μ=13 inches  and a standard deviation of σ = 2 inches. Approximately what percentage of plants in this region are between 10 and 14 inches tall?
