1. Recap the very basics of R
2. Indexing
3. Creating tables

# R and R studio

```{r  out.height="100%", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rpic.png") 
```

---
# R Studio 

```{r  out.height="60%", out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r.png") 
```

# R Markdown

Within R Studio, we can create a type of document called Markdown. 

- Neat way of combining code + text 

- Used for final documents/presentation of results/assignments 

- Has a visual editor that makes it look like a normal word processor

---
# R as a calculator

```{r}
2+2
2/3
log(10)
abs(-1)
sqrt(9)
```

---
# Logical statements

.med[Common logical operators: 

  - == (is equal)
  - != (not equal)
  - < (greater than), > (less than)
  - & (and), | (or)
]

---
# Logical statements

```{r}
1 < 2

1 == 2

2 != 2

1 > 0 & 2 > 0

1 < 0 | 2 <= 3
```

---
# The Grammar of R

Verb(noun, adjective) is the same as

.green[***function(object, other arguments)***]

The other argument (adjective) is not always necessary

---
# Functions

Like in math: input, output 

Actions that you want R to carry out 

eg. `mean()`

---

# Objects

R is based on objects: variables, functions, dataframes, etc.

We usually want to store objects so we can work with them later. We do this by attributing a name to that object. 

```{r}
big_number <- 12345.6789
```

Check out your Environment! 

---
# Objects 

Objects can be of different types (or "class")


Most common class of objects: numeric, character, logical, matrix, data.frame, list, function.

---
# Objects 

```{r}
year <- 2021
class(year)
```

--

```{r}
course_name <- "PS 409"
class(course_name)
```


---
# Vectors (combining objects)

A vector is a combination of more than one object (of the same class). We can create vectors with c() which stands for "combine". 

```{r}
courses <- c("PS 403", "PS 405", "PS 406")
class(courses)
```
--

```{r}
avg_grade <- c(88, 95, 82)
class(avg_grade)
```

---
# Class matters 

Why does object class matter?

What R can do depends on the class. 

Let's say for some reason our grade data was imported as character: 
```{r}
chr_grade <- c("88", "89", "94")
mean(chr_grade)
```

---
# Summary stats 

With numeric variables, we can run the following commands to get descriptive statistics: 

- `mean`, `sd`, `max`, `min` ... 

- `summary` gives them all at once

---
# Datasets (combining vectors)

  - Data frames are the core data structure in R
  
  - Data frames are .green[heterogenous]: the vectors in a data frames can each be of a different data type.
  
  - Columns are typically variables and rows are observations.
  
---
# Datasets 

```{r}
dataset <- data.frame(courses = c("PS 403", "PS 405", "PS 406"), 
                 avg_grade = c(88, 95, 82))
dataset
```

---
# Indexing

Data frames (and any other object) can be indexed by using variable/column names: `df$var` or `df["var"]`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataset[1]

dataset["courses"]

dataset$courses

```

---
# Indexing

The indexing can be conditional too (and can include more than one condition).

Note the structure: 

```{r}
dataset$avg_grade[dataset$courses == "PS 403"]
```

---
# Side note: packages

Let's practice indexing with the Gapminder dataset. For this, we need to install and load the package called `gapminder`


Recap: 

| On phone     | On R                 |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Download app | install.packages("") |
| Open app     | library()            |

---
# Side note: packages

If you load a library without installing it first, you will get this error:

```{r error= TRUE}
library(BioConductor)
```

--
If you try to run a command from a package without loading it first, you will get this error:

```{r error=TRUE}
stargazer(mtcars)
```

---
# Indexing 

Back to indexing: 

```{r}
library(gapminder)

test_data <- gapminder 
```

---
# Indexing

First, let's explore the dataset. Try out the commands: `head`, `names`, `View`. 

```{r}
head(test_data)
```

---
class: inverse

# Indexing

1. Index the "country" variable. (Is this helpful?)

2. Look for the gdpPercap for Mexico. (Is this helpful?)

3. Look for the gdpPercap for Mexico in 2007

BONUS. Get the mean of the gdpPercap for the all countries in 2007

---
class: inverse

# Indexing

1. Index the "country" variable. (Is this helpful?)

```{r}
test_data$country 
#test_data["country"]
```
---
class: inverse

# Indexing

2. Look for the gdpPercap for Mexico. (Is this helpful?)

```{r}
test_data$gdpPercap[test_data$country=="Mexico"]
```

---
class: inverse

# Indexing

3. Look for the gdpPercap for Mexico in 2007

```{r}
test_data$gdpPercap[test_data$country=="Mexico" & test_data$year==2007]
```

---
# Indexing

BONUS

```{r}
mean(test_data$gdpPercap[test_data$year==2007])
```

---
# Indexing

This is also helpful in other ocassions 

```{r}
reg1 <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data= test_data)
```

Type `reg1$` and see what options show up. 


---
# Tables 

Indexing is also helpful to create tables in Base R. 

One-way tables are useful to see the values the variable takes on and how it is distributed.

```{r}
table(test_data$continent)
```

Compare this with `test_data$continent`

---
# Tables

Two way tables allow us to see how two variables are related to each other. 

Let's see how many observations(continent) we have per year:

```{r}
table(test_data$continent, test_data$year)
```

---
# Tables

Often, it will be more informative to see these numbers as proportions.

To do this, we simply add `prop.table` to the command above:

```{r}
prop.table(table(test_data$continent, test_data$year))
```
---
# Tables

To do this, we simply add `prop.table` to the command above.

```{r}
prop.table(table(test_data$continent, test_data$year),1)
```


---
# Loading dataset from file

1) Set your working directory (or create a R Project)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("")

getwd()
```

2) Match command with file type (and library!): read_csv, read_xlsx, read_dta... 

---
# Loading dataset from file

```{r}
library(readr)
drugs_data <- read_csv("drugs.csv")
```

Common mistakes: 
- Not including quotations
- Not including file extension (.csv)
- Misspelling file name 

---
class: inverse

# Practice

1) Explore the dataset using `names`, `head`, or `View`. What is the dataset about? What are the rows/columns?

2) What is the average age at which people try cigarettes (cigtry)? 

3) Is there an association between Health Condition (health_cond) and level of education (educ)? Draw a table between these two variables.
